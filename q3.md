It is not possible to exhaustively test the syntax of the "air book request" command, because the command can
have an infinite number of flight segment lines. The number of derivations is infinite. Therefore, it is not
possible to exhaustively test the syntax of GLADIUS commands.

If we restrict ourselves to the “shop flight fare” command, then there are a finite number of derivations. We
can calculate the number of derivations by inspecting the relevant grammar rules.

Let N(\<a\>) represent the number of derivations of the non-terminal \<a\>.

\<airport\> ::= [A-D] [A-D] [A-D]  
N(\<airport\>) = 4^3 = 64

\<trip_type\> ::= "OneWay" | ("Return" \<space\> ("1"? [0-9]) | "20")  
N(\<trip_type\>) = 1 + 21 = 22

\<cabin_type\> ::= "P" | "F" | "J" | "C" | "S" | "Y"  
N(\<cabin_type\>) = 6

\<departure_date\> ::= [0-9] [0-9] [0-9] [0-9] "-" [0-9] [0-9] "-" [0-9] [0-9]  
N(\<departure_date\>) = 10^8

\<shop_command\> ::= "shop flight fares" \<space\> \<airport\> \<space\> \<airport\> \<space\> \<trip_type\> \<space\>
\<cabin_type\> \<space\> \<departure_date\>  
N(\<shop_command\>) = 64 \* 64 \* 22 \* 6 \* 10^8 = 54,067,200,000,000 = 5.40672 \* 10^13

If we assume each test takes 1μs, and the test must be able to complete on one core of one computer, the time
it would take to test every derivation of the “shop flight fare” command in hours is
5.40672 \* 10^13 \* 10^-6 / 60 / 60 ≈ 150,187 hours. This is still infeasible to test exhaustively.
